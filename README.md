# dog-ceo-api
Pretty much [this API](https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api) but written in Go for practice. 

# TODO
- Fetch images and add to repo/backend image
- Use data file for state (json file)
- Use postgres DB for state
- Add routes listed in comments
- Duplicate routes but behind a single parent *//* which mimics error responses (eg randomly return a 500, 404 etc)
- Put images in S3 (run locally with localstack)
